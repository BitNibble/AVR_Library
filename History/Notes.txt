A micro controller is nothing more then circuits being controlled by registers, instead of before where 
these circuits where made fixed, now this hardware just has the options enabled for change. timers, 
adc s, spi, uart, multiplexers, shift registers, adders, i2c, ios, etc. A simple layer of hardware 
was just dropped on top to control the options available of these circuits. Therefore thinking code 
with the mindset of how the hardware works, the logic circuits, etc, just makes it more reliable. Maybe for
starters should first be introduced to the logic circuits, TTL and CMOS, all those chips 74HC series and the 
4000, then the timer and multiplexers, shifters and math operator flip-flops, latches, tri-state drivers chips, etc, 
knowing how they operate is a plus when coding and browsing the data sheet schematics.
To know what a mcu can do is just put all the control registers in series and count all the bits (n), then do 2^n 
and you have the possible cases. It is then limited.

note: not defining interrupt function, or initializing an object will block the program.

/**********************/
having the image with procedures has implications of very high dependency, but on
the other hand turns tasks easier.

Having only the hardware image helps imense when shared by all other libraries, less
dependente and centralized, may be better, it has more separation. Do not know whitch 
is better, maybe will bet in more division, and use only the image, and make all other 
libraries dependente on it, not including subroutines on the image.

It only means a bigger header in the main file nothing less.

/**********************/
First layer is hardware matching, second layer is harware matching with library module 
spawning new intances of selected module, resumed have intance representing the microcontroller
that then can create intances of indidual circuits of the microcontroller, having the option 
to just work with the modules independently.

Tera Term:

sending AT commands to bluetooth modules.
Setup->Terminal:
New-Line -> Transmit -> CR+LF
Radio Button "Local Echo" <- Selected
Setup -> Serial port -> speed: xxxxxx -> Data: 8bit -> Parity: none -> Stop bits: 1 -> Flow control: none

default speed for AT commands 38400Kbits/sec

To send data must copy text to clipboard then paste to terminal window (black bacground windows), 
a pop up menu with text will appear, then select ok to send text.
